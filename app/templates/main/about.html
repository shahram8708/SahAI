      <p>
        SahAI ðŸŒ± was born from lived experience: Indian students under exam pressure, craving a
        confidential ally. Unlike social media or formal therapy, SahAI is private-by-default,
        culturally resonant, and stigma-free.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To empower youth with gentle, everyday tools for reflection and resilience â€”
        without judgment, without exposure. One journal, one doodle, one leaf at a time.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Why Privacy First?</h2>
      <p>
        Every feature is designed with <strong>confidentiality</strong> in mind:
        no raw text stored unless opted-in, no ads, no third-party data sharing.
        AI summaries help you reflect, not track you.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to partner with schools and NGOs, expand into more Indian languages,
        and create a stigma-free ally for millions of youth.
